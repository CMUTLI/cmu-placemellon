# PlaceMellon

Placeholder images of Carnegie Mellon, in the spirit of placekitten.
Give it a width and height, and it returns a CMU photo cropped to that size.
It also provides grayscale images, random photos, and Scotty images and
profile pictures.

Photos come from University Communications & Marketing's CMU Selects
collection. Use them for Carnegie Mellon work; see the
[photo source and usage information](https://cmu-web.github.io/cmu-web-placemellon/about.html).

## Get started

Put a PlaceMellon URL in an image tag:

```html
<img src="https://placemellon.andrew.cmu.edu/400/300" alt="Placeholder photo of Carnegie Mellon" />
```

This returns a photo 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels tall. The same size gets
the same photo unless you select the random option or the photo collection
changes.

The [image builder](https://cmu-web.github.io/cmu-web-placemellon/builder.html)
lets you choose a size and options, preview the image, and copy its URL or
HTML. The [options reference](https://cmu-web.github.io/cmu-web-placemellon/options.html)
covers categories, random photos, grayscale, and Scotty.
